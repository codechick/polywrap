# Polywrap
Just a Polyglot's wrapper for Webpack-based projects that allows dynamic loading of big translation files.
It exploits [code splitting](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html), [load context](http://webpack.github.io/docs/context.html) and [Bundle loader](https://github.com/webpack/bundle-loader).

In this very moment is more an idea / concept than a mature script. But I'm glad if someone is inspired by this.

# How to test it
Just run `npm run start` and browse to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
